# GRAD_CAM
In this tutorial, we re-code the GradCam algorithm, which visualizes as a heatmap the areas used by a convolutional neural network (CNN) during a classfication task. 
We experimentally demonstrate that the heat-map converges on the area of the image that a human (i.e. us) would have found useful for the classification problem. 

Final grade 18/20.
